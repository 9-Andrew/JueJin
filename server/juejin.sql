    } }`\r\n\r\n我们看到在调用getPackageInfo方法时，最终调用了getPackageInfoAsUser方法，在这个方法中，我们看到有一个变量mPM，看样子就是PKMS的一个代理对象，所以我们只需要确定mPM是哪个类的对象即可。\r\n\r\njava\r\n\r\n复制代码\r\n\r\n`private final IPackageManager mPM;`\r\n\r\n从源码中可以看到，mPM是IPackageManager的一个实例对象，而IPackageManager就是 SystemServer和客户端进程间通信的aidl，其路径在下面：\r\n\r\n### [frameworks](https://www.androidos.net.cn/android/10.0.0_r6/xref/frameworks \"https://www.androidos.net.cn/android/10.0.0_r6/xref/frameworks\")/[base](https://www.androidos.net.cn/android/10.0.0_r6/xref/frameworks/base \"https://www.androidos.net.cn/android/10.0.0_r6/xref/frameworks/base\")/[core](https://www.androidos.net.cn/android/10.0.0_r6/xref/frameworks/base/core \"https://www.androidos.net.cn/android/10.0.0_r6/xref/frameworks/base/core\")/[java](https://www.androidos.net.cn/android/10.0.0_r6/xref/frameworks/base/core/java \"https://www.androidos.net.cn/android/10.0.0_r6/xref/frameworks/base/core/java\")/[android](https://www.androidos.net.cn/android/10.0.0_r6/xref/frameworks/base/core/java/android \"https://www.androidos.net.cn/android/10.0.0_r6/xref/frameworks/base/core/java/android\")/[content](https://www.androidos.net.cn/android/10.0.0_r6/xref/frameworks/base/core/java/android/content \"https://www.androidos.net.cn/android/10.0.0_r6/xref/frameworks/base/core/java/android/content\")/[pm](https://www.androidos.net.cn/android/10.0.0_r6/xref/frameworks/base/core/java/android/content/pm \"https://www.androidos.net.cn/android/10.0.0_r6/xref/frameworks/base/core/java/android/content/pm\")/IPackageManager.aidl\r\n\r\n因为这个文件里的方法太多了，我就不贴出来了，有兴趣的伙伴可以自行查看。\r\n\r\n那么mPM是在什么时候初始化的呢？\r\n\r\njava\r\n\r\n复制代码\r\n\r\n`protected ApplicationPackageManager(ContextImpl context,     IPackageManager pm) {     mContext = context;     mPM = pm; }`\r\n\r\n通过源码我们发现，在ApplicationPackageManager的构造方法中，我们看到会对其进行赋值，因此我们前面看到getPackageManager方法调用时，应该就是创建了ApplicationPackageManager对象。\r\n\r\njava\r\n\r\n复制代码\r\n\r\n`@Override public PackageManager getPackageManager() {     if (mPackageManager != null) {         return mPackageManager;     }     IPackageManager pm = ActivityThread.getPackageManager();     if (pm != null) {         // Doesn\'t matter if we make more than one instance.         return (mPackageManager = new ApplicationPackageManager(this, pm));     }     return null; }`\r\n\r\n所以在getPackageInfoAsUser方法中，就是调用了PKMS的getPackageInfo方法，所以C/S之间的通信方式如下：\r\n\r\n![image.png](https://p6-juejin.byteimg.com/tos-cn-i-k3u1fbpfcp/c60b68574afb49f5b4e29b929d98efb6~tplv-k3u1fbpfcp-zoom-in-crop-mark:1512:0:0:0.awebp?)\r\n\r\n## 1.2 PKMS启动流程分析\r\n\r\n前面我们提了一嘴，在SystemServer进程启动之后，就会启动PKMS，现在我们详细分析一下，PKMS的启动流程到底干了什么事。\r\n\r\n### 1.2.1 SystemServer引导服务启动流程\r\n\r\n具体的SystemServer启动流程，感兴趣的伙伴可以去前面的文章中看，我们直接进入到SystemServer的startBootstrapServices方法中。\r\n\r\njava\r\n\r\n复制代码\r\n\r\n`try {     Watchdog.getInstance().pauseWatchingCurrentThread(\"packagemanagermain\");     mPackageManagerService = PackageManagerService.main(mSystemContext, installer,             mFactoryTestMode != FactoryTest.FACTORY_TEST_OFF, mOnlyCore); } finally {     Watchdog.getInstance().resumeWatchingCurrentThread(\"packagemanagermain\"); }`\r\n\r\n跳过其他服务的启动，我们看到在启动PackageManagerService服务的时候，是直接调用了其mian方法。\r\n\r\njava\r\n\r\n复制代码\r\n\r\n`// Wait for installd to finish starting up so that it has a chance to // create critical directories such as /data/user with the appropriate // permissions.  We need this to complete before we initialize other services. t.traceBegin(\"StartInstaller\"); Installer installer = mSystemServiceManager.startService(Installer.class); t.traceEnd();`\r\n\r\n在此之前，我们先关注一个Installer服务，通过注释我们发现这个服务还是挺重要的，**在初始化其他服务之前，首先要保证Installer服务的启动已经完成。**\r\n\r\njava\r\n\r\n复制代码\r\n\r\n`Only run \"core\" apps if we\'re encrypting the device. String cryptState = VoldProperties.decrypt().orElse(\"\"); if (ENCRYPTING_STATE.equals(cryptState)) {     Slog.w(TAG, \"Detected encryption in progress - only parsing core apps\");     mOnlyCore = true; } else if (ENCRYPTED_STATE.equals(cryptState)) {     Slog.w(TAG, \"Device encrypted - only parsing core apps\");     mOnlyCore = true; }`\r\n\r\n然后会判断手机是否加密了，例如设置了手机密码，那么就只会解析core app，像做车载应用，通常都会将这个变量写死为false，因为没有隐私相关的app可以使用，一般车载也不会有设置密码这个选项。\r\n\r\n然后就会调用PackageManagerService的main方法，这里我们看到是把installer服务、手机是否加密作为变量参数传进去了。**伙伴们注意一下，这个方法是一个耗时方法，而且在手机开启启动的时候会慢，也是这个方法在捣鬼。**\r\n\r\n在启动PKMS完成之后，会根据手机设备是否加密，来决定是否启动OtaDexoptService服务。OtaDexoptService主要用来管理A/B升级和OTA升级以及dex文件优化，对于这两个升级名词如果做过系统升级的伙伴可能会了解，当系统升级时，端上会调用OS与A/B升级和OTA升级相关的接口，完成系统升级。\r\n\r\njava\r\n\r\n复制代码\r\n\r\n`// Manages A/B OTA dexopting. This is a bootstrap service as we need it to rename // A/B artifacts after boot, before anything else might touch/need them. // Note: this isn\'t needed during decryption (we don\'t have /data anyways). if (!mOnlyCore) {     boolean disableOtaDexopt = SystemProperties.getBoolean(\"config.disable_otadexopt\",             false);     if (!disableOtaDexopt) {         t.traceBegin(\"StartOtaDexOptService\");         try {             Watchdog.getInstance().pauseWatchingCurrentThread(\"moveab\");             OtaDexoptService.main(mSystemContext, mPackageManagerService);         } catch (Throwable e) {             reportWtf(\"starting OtaDexOptService\", e);         } finally {             Watchdog.getInstance().resumeWatchingCurrentThread(\"moveab\");             t.traceEnd();         }     } }`\r\n\r\n当然更新策略也是根据app等级划分，core app > system app > other app，所以硬件设备是否支持加密（设置密码），对OTA升级有着直接影响。\r\n\r\n对于dex的优化，就是在引导服务流程结束之后，在startOtherServices方法中进行的。\r\n\r\n### 1.2.2 其他服务启动startOtherServices\r\n\r\njava\r\n\r\n复制代码\r\n\r\n`private void startOtherServices(@NonNull TimingsTraceAndSlog t) {     // ......     if (!mOnlyCore) {         t.traceBegin(\"UpdatePackagesIfNeeded\");         try {             Watchdog.getInstance().pauseWatchingCurrentThread(\"dexopt\");             mPackageManagerService.updatePackagesIfNeeded();         } catch (Throwable e) {             reportWtf(\"update packages\", e);         } finally {             Watchdog.getInstance().resumeWatchingCurrentThread(\"dexopt\");         }         t.traceEnd();     }     // ......          try {         //完成磁盘清理维护         mPackageManagerService.performFstrimIfNeeded();     } catch (Throwable e) {         reportWtf(\"performing fstrim\", e);     }          // ......     mPackageManagerService.systemReady(); }`\r\n\r\n这里只看与PKMS相关的处理；首先会判断手机是否加密，如果没有加密，那么就会判断是否有package需要更新，dex是否需要优化。\r\n\r\n然后会调用performFstrimIfNeeded进行磁盘清理，最后重要的一步就是会调用systemReady方法，表示PKMS准备就绪了，如果这个时候服务出现异常，那么后续服务就不会再初始化，就会导致手机开启死机。\r\n\r\n那么这里我们总结一下，PKMS准备就绪需要的环节：\r\n\r\n-   启动Installer服务，是阻塞的，后续服务初始化的前提；\r\n-   判断手机是否加密，如果加密，则mOnlyCore = true，否则为false；\r\n-   执行PKMS的main方法，耗时阻塞的；\r\n-   根据mOnlyCore决定启动升级服务OtaDexoptService；\r\n-   根据mOnlyCore判断是否需要检查包更新，即调用PKMS的updatePackagesIfNeeded；\r\n-   调用PKMS的performFstrimIfNeeded方法进行磁盘清理；\r\n-   执行PKMS的systemReady方法，表示PKMS已经准备就绪了。\r\n\r\n所以当手机启动比较慢的时候，分析原因就可以从这几个方向入手。\r\n\r\n# 2 PKMS main方法分析\r\n\r\n前面主要介绍了PKMS在启动时到准备就绪的7个步骤，其中在第3步中调用了PKMS的main方法，我们看下在main方法中的处理逻辑。\r\n\r\njava\r\n\r\n复制代码\r\n\r\n`public static PackageManagerService main(Context context, Installer installer,         boolean factoryTest, boolean onlyCore) {     // Self-check for initial settings.

日益成熟，那么应用层的创新也会出现，在没有更简洁的设备出现前，手机还是主要载体，总归是需要移动开发去接入的，如果硬件层越来越好，模型直接跑在手机上也不是不可能，所以对跨平台技术也会是新一层的考验，有可能直接去跨平台化了。毕竟去中台化也成了历史的选择。\r\n\r\n因而，在这个存量市场，虽然竞争压力很大，但是如果技术过硬，还是能寻求一席之地的。因而我决定用几篇文章来介绍下，当前我认为的现代化

现代化 Android 开发：Jetpack Compose 最佳实践\r\n-   现代化 Android 开发：性能监控\r\n\r\n# Scope\r\n\r\n提到 `Android` 基础架构，大家可能首先想到的是 `MVC`、`MVP`、`MVVM`、`MVI` 等分层架构。但针对现代化的 `Android` 开发，我们首要有的是 `scope` 的概念。其可以分两个方面：\r\n\r\n-   结构化并发之 `CoroutineScope`：目前协程基本已经是最推荐的并发工具了，`CoroutineScope` 的就是对并发任务的管理，例如 `viewModelScope` 启动的任务的生命周期就小于 `viewModel` 的存活周期。\r\n-   依赖注入之 `KoinScope`：虽然官方推荐的是 `hilt`，但其实它并没有 `koin` 好用与简洁，所以我还是推荐 `koin`。`KoinScope` 是对实例对象的管理，如果 `scope` 结束， 那么 `scope` 管理的所有实例都被销毁。\r\n\r\n一般应用总会有登录，所以大体的 `scope` 管理流程图是这样的：\r\n\r\n![scope](https://p3-juejin.byteimg.com/tos-cn-i-k3u1fbpfcp/fcbca9003ab7405d813f6439c93dd157~tplv-k3u1fbpfcp-zoom-in-crop-mark:1512:0:0:0.awebp)\r\n\r\n-   我们启动 `app`， 创建 `AppScope`，对于 `koin` 而言就是用于存放单例，对于协程来说就是全局任务\r\n-   当我们登录后，创建 `AuthSessionScope`, 对于 `koin` 而言，就是存放用户相关的单例，对于协程而言就是用户执行相关的任务。当退出登录时，销毁当前的 `AuthSessionScope`，那么其对应的对象实例、任务全部都会被销毁。用户再次登录，就再次重新创建 `AuthSessionScope`。目前很多 `App` 对于用户域内的实例，基本上还是用单例来实现，退出登录时，没得办法，就只能杀死整个进程再重启, 所以会有黑屏现象，实现不算优雅。而用 `scope` 管理后，就是一件很自然而实现的事情了。所以尽量用依赖注入，而不要用单例模式\r\n-   当我们进入界面后，一般都是从逻辑层获取数据进行渲染，所以依赖注入没多大用了。而协程的 `lifecycleScope`、`viewModelScope` 就比较有用，管理界面相关的异步任务。\r\n\r\n所以我们在做架构、做某些业务时，首要考虑 `scope` 的问题。我们可以把 `CoroutineScope` 也作为实例存放到 `KoinScope` 里，也可以把 `KoinScope` 作为 `Context` 存放到 `CorutineScope` 里。\r\n\r\n岐黄小筑是将 `CoroutineScope` 放到 `koin` 里去以便依赖查找\r\n\r\nkotlin\r\n\r\n复制代码\r\n\r\n`val sessionCoroutineScope = CoroutineScope(Dispatchers.IO + SupervisorJob() + coroutineLogExceptionHandler(TAG)) val sessionKoinScope = GlobalContext.get().createScope(...) sessionKoinScope.declare(sessionCoroutineScope)`\r\n\r\n> 其实我们也完全可以用 `CoroutineScope` 的 `Context` 来做实例管理，而移除 `koin` 的使用。但是 `Context` 的使用并没有那么便捷，或许以后它可以进化为完全取代 `koin`。\r\n\r\n# 架构分层\r\n\r\n随着软件复杂度的提升，`MVC`、`MVP`、`MVVM`、`MVI` 等先后被提出，但我觉得目前所有的开发，都大体遵循某一模式而又不完全遵循，很容易因为业务的节奏，很容易打破，变成怎么方便怎么来。所以使用简单的分层 + 足够优秀的组件化，才是保证开发模式不被打破的最佳实践。下图是岐黄小筑的整体架构图：\r\n\r\n![](https://p3-juejin.byteimg.com/tos-cn-i-k3u1fbpfcp/8cf2f99ac6f44bb19a72f27aa05f64dc~tplv-k3u1fbpfcp-zoom-in-crop-mark:1512:0:0:0.awebp)\r\n\r\n整体架构不算复杂，其实重点是在于组件库，`emo` 已经有 20 个子库了，然后岐黄小筑有一些对于通用逻辑的抽象与封装，使得逻辑层虽然都集中在 `logic` 层，但整体都是写模板式的代码，可以面向 `copy-paste` 编程。\r\n\r\n以 `BookLogic` 为例：\r\n\r\nkotlin\r\n\r\n复制代码\r\n\r\n``// 通过依赖注入传参， 拿到 db 层、网络层、以及用户态信息的应用 class BookLogic(     val authSession: AuthSession,     val kv: EmoKV,     val db: AccountDataBase,     private val bookApi: BookApi ) {     // 并发请求复用管理     private val concurrencyShare = ConcurrencyShare(successResultKeepTime = 10 * 1000L)     // 加载书籍信息，使用封装好的通用请求组件     fun logicBookInfo(bookId: Int, mode: Int = 0) = logic(         scope = authSession.coroutineScope, // 使用用户 session 协程 scope，因为有请求复用，所以退出界面，再进入，会复用之前的网络请求         mode = mode,         dbAction = { // 从 db 读取本地数据             db.bookDao().bookInfo(bookId)         },         syncAction = { // 从网络同步数据             concurrencyShare.joinPreviousOrRun(\"syncBookInfo-$bookId\") {                 bookApi.bookInfo(bookId).syncThen { _, data ->                     db.runInTransaction {                         db.userDao().insert(data.author)                         db.bookDao().insert(data.info)                     }                     SyncRet.Full                 }             }         }     )     // 类似的模板代码     suspend fun logicBookClassicContent(bookId: Int, mode: Int = 0) = logic(...)     suspend fun logicBookExpoundContent(bookId: Int, mode: Int = 0) = logic(...)     ... } //将其注册到 `module` 中去，目前好像也可以通过注解的方式来做，不过我还没采用那种方式： scopedOf(::BookLogic)``\r\n\r\n`ViewModel` 层浮层从 `Logic` 层读取数据，并可以进行特殊化处理：\r\n\r\nkotlin\r\n\r\n复制代码\r\n\r\n`class BookInfoViewModel(navBackStackEntry: NavBackStackEntry) : ViewModel() {     val bookId = navBackStackEntry.arguments?.getInt(SchemeConst.ARG_BOOK_ID) ?: throw RuntimeException(\"book_id is required!.\")     val bookInfoFlow = MutableStateFlow(logicResultLoading<BookInfoPojo>())     init {         viewModelScope.launch {             runInBookLogic {                 logicBookInfo(bookId, mode).collectLatest {                     bookInfoFlow.emit(it)                 }             }         }     } }`\r\n\r\n`Compose` 界面再使用 `ViewModel`：\r\n\r\nkotlin\r\n\r\n复制代码\r\n\r\n`@ComposeScheme(     action = SchemeConst.ACTION_BOOK_INFO,     alternativeHosts = [BookActivity::class] ) @SchemeIntArg(name = SchemeConst.ARG_BOOK_ID) @Composable fun BookInfoPage(navBackStackEntry: NavBackStackEntry) {     LogicPage(navBackStackEntry = navBackStackEntry) {         val infoVm = schemeActivityViewModel<BookInfoViewModel>(navBackStackEntry)         val detailVm = schemeViewModel<BookDetailViewModel>(navBackStackEntry)         val bookInfo by infoVm.bookInfoFlow.collectAsStateWithLifecycle()         //...     } }`\r\n\r\n这样整个数据流从网络加载、到存储到数据库、到传递给 `UI` 进行渲染的整个流程就结束了。\r\n\r\n对于其中更多的细节，例如逻辑层具体是怎么封装的？`UI` 层具体是怎么使用多 `Activity` 多 `Page`？可以期待下之后的文章。', '', 3, 653, 478, '2023-06-04 22:25:13');

vue3有bug!\r\n\r\n原来使用的时候必须要使用\r\n\r\n-   由 `v-if` 所触发的切换\r\n-   由 `v-show` 所触发的切换\r\n\r\n基于这个特性,可以配合弹层关闭的效果\r\n\r\n##### 弹层自动关闭\r\n\r\njs\r\n\r\n复制代码\r\n\r\n`const { type = \'success\',duration=1500 } = defineProps<{   type?: Type,   text: string,   duration?:number // 传入展示弹层的时间(可选,默认显示1500) }>() const isShow = ref(false) // 当组件被挂载完成就显示 onMounted(()=> {   isShow.value = true   // 当duration时间过后，就隐藏   window.setTimeout(() => {     isShow.value = false   }, duration) }) <Transition name=\"down\">     <div class=\"message\" :style=\"style[type]\" v-if=\"isShow\">       <i class=\"iconfont\" :class=\"style[type].icon\"></i>       <!-- <span class=\"text\"><slot></slot></span> -->       <!-- 改造一下 -->       <span class=\"text\">{{ text }}</span>     </div> </Transition>`\r\n\r\n此时就完了利用组件完成功能\r\n\r\n上面说到,最终是需要通过引入方法的方式来实现,并且使用的方法是\r\n\r\njs\r\n\r\n复制代码\r\n\r\n`// Message({type:\'success\'}, \'登录成功\') // Message({type:\'error\'}, \'登录失败\') // Message.success(\'登录成功\') // Message.error(\'登录失败\')`\r\n\r\n这时候就需要使用\r\n\r\n首先按照文档学习一下vue3中h函数的使用方法\r\n\r\n##### 初识h函数\r\n\r\njs\r\n\r\n复制代码\r\n\r\n`import { h, render } from \"vue\"; // 1. 创建vnode // 第一个参数是标签名称或者是组件名称 // 第二个参数是属性 // 第三个参数是显示内容 const vnode = h(\'h1\', { class: \'title\' }, \'hello world\') // 2. render渲染  // 第一个参数是需要渲染的内容 // 第二个参数是挂载到哪个地方 render(vnode,document.getElementById(\'app\'))`\r\n\r\n此时页面中就可以出现h1标签内容为hello world\r\n\r\n![9389d344d21e9def282cc7b1cc84f5b.png](https://p9-juejin.byteimg.com/tos-cn-i-k3u1fbpfcp/f66388190b7240b2bc4629807dc64c02~tplv-k3u1fbpfcp-zoom-in-crop-mark:1512:0:0:0.awebp?)\r\n\r\n好, 有了h函数以及render的知识铺垫,我们接着写message组件\r\n\r\n##### 利用h函数改造message组件\r\n\r\n首先我们在对应的components下的messaga文件夹下创建index.ts文件\r\n\r\njs\r\n\r\n复制代码\r\n\r\n`import { h, render } from \"vue\" import MyMessage from \"@/components/message/message.vue\" // 往body中系只能一个盒子,目的是同时只能出现一次消息弹层 const divContainer = document.createElement(\'div\') as HTMLDivElement divContainer.classList.add(\'message-container\') document.body.appendChild(divContainer) // 按照基本写法的方式书写h函数 // 1. 创建vnode const vnode = h(MyMessage,{type,text}) render(vnode,divContainer)`\r\n\r\n此时就完成了基本的功能,但是我们最终要导入方法并 Message({type:\'success\'}, \'登录成功\')来使用,也就是调用函数的方法使用\r\n\r\njs\r\n\r\n复制代码\r\n\r\n`// 使用函数 type Params = {  type: \'success\' | \'error\' | \'warning\',  text: string,  duration?: number } function Message({ type, text, duration = 2000 }: Params) {  // 如果要像elui一样点击就创建 并且多次点击创建多个可以帮创建放在里面  // 往body中新增一个盒子 =>为了代码中  const divContainer = document.createElement(\'div\') as HTMLDivElement  divContainer.classList.add(\'message-container\')  document.body.appendChild(divContainer)  // 1. 创建虚拟dom  // const vNode = h(MyMessage, { type, text })  const vNode = h(MyMessage, { type, text })  // 2. 动态render  render(vNode, divContainer)  clearTimeout(timer)  // 3. 开启一个延时器,到时间就隐藏  timer = setTimeout(() => {   render(null, divContainer)   }, duration) }`\r\n\r\n##### 优化message组件的使用\r\n\r\n实际开发中,我们更希望利用\r\n\r\nMessage.success(\'成功\') Message.error(\'失败\') Message.warning(\'警告\') 来简化代码\r\n\r\n这就相当于帮我们再次封装了一层函数的调用\r\n\r\njs\r\n\r\n复制代码\r\n\r\n`// components/message/index.ts Message.success = (text: string, duration?: number) => {  Message({   text,   type: \'success\',   duration  }) } Message.error = (text: string, duration?: number) => {  Message({   text,   type: \'error\',   duration  }) } Message.warning = (text: string, duration?: number) => {  Message({   text,   type: \'warning\',   duration  }) }`\r\n\r\n在项目中的使用\r\n\r\njs\r\n\r\n复制代码\r\n\r\n`// 点击按钮 出现message弹层 const showSuccess = () => {   Message.success(\'成功\') } const showError = () => {   Message.error(\'失败\') } const showWarning = () => {   Message.warning(\'警告\') } </script> <template>   <button @click=\"showSuccess\">success</button>   <button @click=\"showError\">error</button>   <button @click=\"showWarning\">warning</button> </template>`\r\n\r\n##### 完结:\r\n\r\n此时我们就完成了message组件的封装, 在没做之前感觉很难,但是实际动手后,其实也是非常简单的, 重在实践, 除此之外,利用h函数也可以封装dialog弹层,原理也是一样的,大家可以动手写一下~\r\n\r\n好啦, 以上就是全部内容, 各位大佬, 可以给小瑜点个赞哦~ 手动撒花_★,°_:.☆(￣▽￣)/$:_.°★_ 。', '', 1, 617, 560, '2023-06-04 22:21:16');

Typically, it is employed as an encrypted version of Telnet. Navicat allows you to transfer data from one database and/or schema to another with detailed analytical process. The Synchronize to Database function will give you a full picture of all database differences. To start working with your server in Navicat, you should first establish a connection or several connections using the Connection window. To connect to a database or schema, simply double-click it in the pane. After comparing data, the window shows the number of records that will be inserted, updated or deleted in the target. Actually it is just in an idea when feel oneself can achieve and cannot achieve. If your Internet Service Provider (ISP) does not provide direct access to its server, Secure Tunneling Protocol (SSH) / HTTP is another solution. Navicat Monitor can be installed on any local computer or virtual machine and does not require any software installation on the servers being monitored. Navicat provides powerful tools for working with queries: Query Editor for editing the query text directly, and Query Builder, Find Builder or Aggregate Builder for building queries visually.

自定义Bean的性质（Customizing the Nature of a Bean）\r\n\r\nSpring框架提供了许多接口，您可以使用这些接口来定制bean的性质。本节将它们分类如下：\r\n\r\n-   [生命周期回调（Lifecycle Callbacks）](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.3.27/reference/html/core.html#beans-factory-lifecycle \"https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.3.27/reference/html/core.html#beans-factory-lifecycle\")\r\n-   [`ApplicationContextAware` 和 `BeanNameAware`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.3.27/reference/html/core.html#beans-factory-aware \"https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.3.27/reference/html/core.html#beans-factory-aware\")\r\n-   [其它Aware接口（Other `Aware` Interfaces）](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.3.27/reference/html/core.html#aware-list \"https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.3.27/reference/html/core.html#aware-list\")\r\n\r\n### 1.6.1. 生命周期回调（Lifecycle Callbacks）\r\n\r\n要与容器对bean生命周期的管理进行交互，您可以实现Spring `InitializingBean`和`DisposableBean`接口。容器对前者调用`afterPropertiesSet()`，对后者调用`destroy()`，让bean在初始化和销毁bean时执行某些操作。\r\n\r\n> JSR-250 `@PostConstruct`和`@PreDestroy`注解通常被认为是在现代Spring应用程序中接收生命周期回调的最佳实践。使用这些注解意味着您的bean**没有耦合到特定于spring的接口**。详情请参见使用`@PostConstruct`和`@PreDestroy`。如果不希望使用JSR-250注解，但仍希望消除耦合，请考虑初始化方法和销毁方法bean定义元数据。\r\n\r\n> 补充\r\n> \r\n> 实现`bean`的生命周期管理有三种方式：\r\n> \r\n> -   实现`InitializingBean`和`DisposableBean`，存在和Spring接口耦合，不推荐使用\r\n> -   使用JSR-250的`@PostConstruct`和`@PreDestroy`，将`bean`和特定接口解耦\r\n> -   使用XML的`init-method`和`destroy-method`\r\n\r\n在内部，Spring框架使用`BeanPostProcessor`实现来处理它能找到的任何回调接口并调用适当的方法。如果您需要自定义特性或Spring默认不提供的其他生命周期行为，您可以自己实现`BeanPostProcessor`。有关更多信息，请参见[容器扩展点（Container Extension Points）](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.3.27/reference/html/core.html#beans-factory-extension \"https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.3.27/reference/html/core.html#beans-factory-extension\")。\r\n\r\n除了初始化和销毁回调之外，Spring管理的对象还可以实现`Lifecycle`接口，以便这些对象可以参与由容器自己的生命周期的启动和关闭过程。\r\n\r\n本节将描述生命周期回调接口。\r\n\r\n#### 初始化回调（Initialization Callbacks）\r\n\r\n`org.springframework.beans.factory.InitializingBean`接口允许bean在容器在bean上设置了所有必要的属性后执行**初始化工作**。`InitializingBean`接口指定了一个方法:\r\n\r\njava\r\n\r\n复制代码\r\n\r\n`public interface InitializingBean { 	void afterPropertiesSet() throws Exception; }`\r\n\r\n我们建议**不要使用**`InitializingBean`接口，因为它**不必要地将代码耦合到Spring**。另外，我们建议使用`@PostConstruct`注解或指定POJO初始化方法。对于基于XML的配置元数据，可以使用`init-method`属性指定具有无效无参数签名的方法的名称。在Java配置中，您可以使用@Bean的`initMethod`属性。参见[接收生命周期回调（Receiving Lifecycle Callbacks）](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.3.27/reference/html/core.html#beans-java-lifecycle-callbacks \"https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.3.27/reference/html/core.html#beans-java-lifecycle-callbacks\")。考虑下面的例子：\r\n\r\nxml\r\n\r\n复制代码\r\n\r\n`<bean id=\"exampleInitBean\" class=\"examples.ExampleBean\" init-method=\"init\"/>`\r\n\r\njava\r\n\r\n复制代码\r\n\r\n`public class ExampleBean {     public void init() {         // do some initialization work     } }`\r\n\r\n上面的示例几乎与下面的示例(包含两个清单)具有完全相同的效果：\r\n\r\nxml\r\n\r\n复制代码\r\n\r\n`<bean id=\"exampleInitBean\" class=\"examples.AnotherExampleBean\"/>`\r\n\r\njava\r\n\r\n复制代码\r\n\r\n`public class AnotherExampleBean implements InitializingBean {     @Override     public void afterPropertiesSet() {         // do some initialization work     } }`\r\n\r\n但是，前面两个示例中的**第一个示例没有将代码与Spring耦合**。\r\n\r\n#### 销毁回调（Destruction Callbacks）\r\n\r\n实现`org.springframework.beans.factory.DisposableBean`接口可以让bean在包含它的容器被销毁时获得回调。`DisposableBean`接口指定了一个方法：\r\n\r\njava\r\n\r\n复制代码\r\n\r\n`void destroy() throws Exception;`\r\n\r\n我们建议您不要使用`DisposableBean`回调接口，因为它**不必要地将代码耦合到Spring**。另外，我们建议使用[`@PreDestroy`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.3.27/reference/html/core.html#beans-postconstruct-and-predestroy-annotations \"https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.3.27/reference/html/core.html#beans-postconstruct-and-predestroy-annotations\")注解或指定bean定义支持的泛型方法。对于基于XML的配置元数据，您可以在`<bean/>`上使用`destroy-method`属性。在Java配置中，您可以使用@Bean的`destroyMethod`属性。参见[接收生命周期回调（Receiving Lifecycle Callbacks）](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.3.27/reference/html/core.html#beans-java-lifecycle-callbacks \"https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.3.27/reference/html/core.html#beans-java-lifecycle-callbacks\")。考虑以下定义:\r\n\r\nxml\r\n\r\n复制代码\r\n\r\n`<bean id=\"exampleInitBean\" class=\"examples.ExampleBean\" destroy-method=\"cleanup\"/>`\r\n\r\njava\r\n\r\n复制代码\r\n\r\n`public class ExampleBean {     public void cleanup() {         // do some destruction work (like releasing pooled connections)     } }`\r\n\r\n上述定义几乎与以下定义具有完全相同的效果：\r\n\r\nxml\r\n\r\n复制代码\r\n\r\n`<bean id=\"exampleInitBean\" class=\"examples.AnotherExampleBean\"/>`\r\n\r\njava\r\n\r\n复制代码\r\n\r\n`public class AnotherExampleBean implements DisposableBean {     @Override     public void destroy() {         // do some destruction work (like releasing pooled connections)     } }`\r\n\r\n但是，前面两个定义中的**第一个没有将代码与Spring耦合**。\r\n\r\n> 你可以为一个`<bea>`元素的属性`destroy-method`设置一个具有一个特殊的(推断的)值，该值指示Spring自动检测特定bean类上的公共`close`或`shutdown`方法。(因此，任何实现`java.lang.AutoCloseable`或`java.io.Closeable`的类都将匹配。)您还可以在`<beans>`的`default-destroy-method`属性上设置这个特殊(推断的)值，用于将此行为应用于整个bean集和(请参阅[默认初始化和销毁方法（Default Initialization and Destroy Methods）](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.3.27/reference/html/core.html#beans-factory-lifecycle-default-init-destroy-methods \"https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.3.27/reference/html/core.html#beans-factory-lifecycle-default-init-destroy-methods\"))。注意，这是Java配置的默认行为。\r\n\r\n#### 默认的初始化和销毁方法（Default Initialization and Destroy Methods）\r\n\r\n当您编写不使用Spring特定的`InitializingBean`和`DisposableBean`回调接口的初始化和销毁方法回调时，您通常使用`init()`、`initialize()`、`dispose()`等名称来编写方法。理想情况下，这种生命周期回调方法的名称**在整个项目中是标准化的**，以便所有开发人员使用相同的方法名称并确保一致性。\r\n\r\n您可以将Spring容器配置为“查找”每个bean上的命名初始化和销毁回调方法名。这意味着，作为应用程序开发人员，您可以编写应用程序类并使用名为`init()`的初始化回调，而不必为每个bean定义配置`init-method=\"init\"`属性。在创建bean时，Spring IoC容器调用该方法(并按照前面描述的标准生命周期回调约定)。这个特性还**强制了**初始化和销毁方法回调的**一致命名约定**。\r\n\r\n假设初始化回调方法命名为`init()`，而销毁回调方法命名为`destroy()`。然后，您的类类似于以下示例中的类：\r\n\r\njava\r\n\r\n复制代码\r\n\r\n`public class DefaultBlogService implements BlogService {     private BlogDao blogDao;     public void setBlogDao(BlogDao blogDao) {         this.blogDao = blogDao;     }     // this is (unsurprisingly) the initialization callback method     public void init() {         if (this.blogDao == null) {             throw new IllegalStateException(\"The [blogDao] property must be set.\");         }     } }`\r\n\r\n然后你可以在bean中使用这个类，如下所示：\r\n\r\nxml\r\n\r\n复制代码\r\n\r\n`<beans default-init-method=\"init\">     <bean id=\"blogService\" class=\"com.something.DefaultBlogService\">         <property name=\"blogDao\" ref=\"blogDao\" />     </bean> </beans>`\r\n\r\n在`<beans>`元素配置了`default-init-method`属性后，Spring IoC容器会识别bean类上名称为`init`的方法为初始化回调方法。在创建和组装bean时，如果bean类有这样的方法，将在适当的时候调用它。\r\n\r\n通过在顶层`<beans>`元素上使用`default-destroy-method`属性，可以类似地配置销毁方法回调(即在XML中)。\r\n\r\n如果现有的bean类已经具有与约定不一致的回调方法，则可以通过使用`<bean>`的`init-method`和`destroy-method`属性指定(在XML中)方法名来覆盖默认值。\r\n\r\nSpring容器保证在为bean**提供所有依赖项后立即调用已配置的初始化回调**。因此，**初始化回调**是**在原始bean引用上调用**的，这意味着**AOP拦截器等等还没有应用到bean**上。首先**完全创建目标bean**，然后应用带有其拦截器链的AOP代理(例如)。如果目标bean和代理是分开定义的，那么您的代码甚至可以与原始目标bean交互，而绕过代理。因此，将拦截器应用于`init`方法是不一致的，因为这样做会将**目标bean的生命周期**与**它的代理或拦截器耦合**，并在代码直接与原始目标bean交互时留下奇怪的语义。\r\n\r\n#### 组合生命周期机制（Combining Lifecycle Mechanisms）\r\n\r\n从Spring 2.5开始，你有三个选项来控制bean的生命周期行为:\r\n\r\n-   [`InitializingBean`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.3.27/reference/html/core.html#beans-factory-lifecycle-initializingbean \"https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.3.27/reference/html/core.html#beans-factory-lifecycle-initializingbean\")和[`DisposableBean`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.3.27/reference/html/core.html#beans-factory-lifecycle-disposablebean \"https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.3.27/reference/html/core.html#beans-factory-lifecycle-disposablebean\")回调接口\r\n-   自定义`init()`和`destroy()`方法\r\n-   [@PostConstruct和@PreDestroy注解](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.3.27/reference/html/core.html#beans-postconstruct-and-predestroy-annotations \"https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.3.27/reference/html/core.html#beans-postconstruct-and-predestroy-annotations\")。\r\n\r\n您可以组合这些机制，用于控制给定的Bean。\r\n\r\n> 提示\r\n> \r\n> 如果为一个bean配置了多个生命周期机制，并且每个机制都配置了不同的方法名，那么每个配置的方法都按照本文后面列出的顺序运行。但是，如果为这些生命周期机制中的一个以上配置了相同的方法名(例如，为初始化方法配置init())，则该方法将运行一次，如前一节所述。\r\n\r\n为同一个bean配置了多个生命周期机制，使用不同的初始化方法，如下所示：\r\n\r\n1.  由`@PostConstruct`注解的方法\r\n2.  由`InitializingBean`回调接口定义的`afterPropertiesSet()`\r\n3.  一个自定义配置的`init()`方法\r\n\r\n销毁方法有着相同的被调用的顺序：\r\n\r\n1.  由`@PreDestroy`注解的方法\r\n2.  由`DisposableBean`回调接口定义的`destroy()`\r\n3.  一个自定义配置的`destroy()`方法\r\n\r\n#### 启动和关闭的回调（Startup and Shutdown Callbacks）\r\n\r\n`Lifecycle`接口为任何有自己生命周期需求的对象定义了基本的方法(比如启动和停止一些后台进程):\r\n\r\njava\r\n\r\n复制代码\r\n\r\n`public interface Lifecycle {     void start();     void stop();     boolean isRunning(); }`\r\n\r\n任何Spring管理的对象都可以实现`Lifecycle`接口。然后，当`ApplicationContext`本身接收到启动和停止信号时(例如，对于运行时的停止/重启场景)，它将这些调用级联到该上下文中定义的`LifeCycle`实现。它通过委托给一个`LifecycleProcessor`来完成这个任务，如下面的清单所示:\r\n\r\njava\r\n\r\n复制代码\r\n\r\n`public interface LifecycleProcessor extends Lifecycle {     void onRefresh();     void onClose(); }`\r\n\r\n注意，`LifecycleProcessor`本身是`Lifecycle`接口的扩展。它还添加了另外两个方法，用于对**正在刷新**和**关闭的上下文**作出反应。\r\n\r\n> 请注意，常规的`org.springframework.context.Lifecycle`接口是用于**显式启动**和**停止**通知的普通约定，并不意味着在上下文刷新时自动启动。要对特定bean的自动启动(包括启动阶段)进行**细粒度控制**，可以考虑实现`org.springframework.context.SmartLifecycle`。\r\n> \r\n> 另外，请注意，停止通知不能保证在销毁之前出现。在常规关闭时，所有`Lifecycle` bean在传播常规销毁回调之前首先收到一个停止通知。但是，在上下文生命周期中的热刷新或停止刷新尝试时，只调用销毁方法。\r\n\r\n**启动和关闭调用的顺序**可能很重要。如果任何两个对象之间存在“依赖”关系，则依赖方在其依赖之后开始，并在其依赖之前停止。然而，有时直接依赖关系是未知的。您可能只知道某种类型的对象应该先于另一类型的对象开始。在这些情况下，`SmartLifecycle`接口定义了另一个选项，即在其父接口`Phased`上定义的`getPhase()`方法。下面的清单显示了`Phased`接口的定义：\r\n\r\njava\r\n\r\n复制代码\r\n\r\n`public interface Phased {     int getPhase(); }`\r\n\r\n`SmartLifecycle`接口的定义如下所示：\r\n\r\njava\r\n\r\n复制代码\r\n\r\n`public interface SmartLifecycle extends Lifecycle, Phased {     boolean isAutoStartup();     void stop(Runnable callback); }`\r\n\r\n启动时，**阶段值最低的对象首先启动**。当**停止时**，**遵循相反的顺序**。因此，一个实现`SmartLifecycle`的对象，其`getPhase()`方法返回`Integer.MIN_VALUE`将是**第一个启动**和**最后一个停止**的。相反，阶段值为`IntegerMAX_VALUE`表示对象应该**最后启动**，首先停止(可能是因为它依赖于正在运行的其他进程)。在考虑阶段值时，同样重要的是要知道，任何没有实现`SmartLifecycle`的“正常”生命周期对象的**默认阶段**都是`0`。因此，任何**负阶段值**都表示一个对象应该在这些标准组件之前启动(并在它们之后停止)。相反，对于任何**正阶段值**都是正确的。\r\n\r\n`SmartLifecycle`定义的停止方法接受回调。任何实现都必须在该实现的关闭过程完成后调用该回调的`run()`方法。这样可以在必要时进行**异步关闭**，因为`LifecycleProcessor`接口的**默认实现**`DefaultLifecycleProcessor`会一直等待到每个阶段中的一组对象调用该回调的超时时间值。**默认的每阶段超时为30秒**。您可以通过在上下文中定义一个名为`lifecycleProcessor`的bean来覆盖默认的生命周期处理器实例。如果你只想修改超时时间，定义以下内容就足够了：\r\n\r\nxml\r\n\r\n复制代码\r\n\r\n`<bean id=\"lifecycleProcessor\" class=\"org.springframework.context.support.DefaultLifecycleProcessor\">     <!-- timeout value in milliseconds -->     <property name=\"timeoutPerShutdownPhase\" value=\"10000\"/> </bean>`\r\n\r\n如前所述，`LifecycleProcessor`接口还定义了用于刷新和关闭上下文的回调方法。后者驱动关闭过程，就像已经显式调用`stop()`一样，但它发生在上下文关闭时。另一方面，“刷新”回调启用了`SmartLifecycle` bean的另一个特性。当上下文被刷新时(在所有对象被实例化和初始化之后)，将调用该回调。此时，默认的生命周期处理器会检查每个`SmartLifecycle`对象的`isAutoStartup()`方法返回的布尔值。如果为`true`，则在这时启动该对象，而不是等待上下文或其自身的`start()`方法的显式调用(与上下文刷新不同，对于标准上下文实现，上下文启动不会自动发生)。阶段（`phase`）值和任何“依赖”关系决定了前面描述的启动顺序。\r\n\r\n#### 在非web应用程序中优雅地关闭Spring IoC容器\r\n\r\n> 提示\r\n> \r\n> 本节仅适用于非web应用。Spring基于web的`ApplicationContext`实现已经有了适当的代码，可以在相关的web应用程序关闭时优雅地关闭Spring IoC容器。\r\n\r\n如果您在**非web应用程序**环境中使用Spring的IoC容器(例如，在富客户端桌面环境中)，请向JVM注册一个**关闭钩子**。这样做可以确保优雅的关闭，并在单例bean上调用相关的销毁方法，以便释放所有资源。您仍然必须正确地配置和实现这些销毁回调。\r\n\r\n要注册一个关闭钩子，调用`ConfigurableApplicationContext`接口上声明的`registerShutdownHook()`方法，如下例所示：\r\n\r\njava\r\n\r\n复制代码\r\n\r\n`import org.springframework.context.ConfigurableApplicationContext; import org.springframework.context.support.ClassPathXmlApplicationContext; public final class Boot {     public static void main(final String[] args) throws Exception {         ConfigurableApplicationContext ctx = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext(\"beans.xml\");         // 为上下文添加一个钩子         ctx.registerShutdownHook();         // 运行程序         // main方法关闭，钩子在程序关闭前被调用     } }`\r\n\r\n### 1.6.2. `AplicationContextAware`和`BeanNameAware`\r\n\r\n当一个`ApplicationContext`创建了一个对象实例来实现`org.springframework.context.ApplicationContextAware`接口时，该实例将被提供一个对该`ApplicationContext`的引用。下面的清单显示了`ApplicationContextAware`接口的定义：\r\n\r\njava\r\n\r\n复制代码\r\n\r\n`public interface ApplicationContextAware {     void setApplicationContext(ApplicationContext applicationContext) throws BeansException; }`\r\n\r\n因此，bean可以通过`ApplicationContext`接口或将引用强制转换为该接口的**已知子类**(例如`ConfigurableApplicationContext`，它公开了额外的功能)，以编程方式操作创建它们的`ApplicationContext`。一种用途是对其他bean进行**编程检索**。有时这个功能很有用。但是，一般情况下，您应该**避免使用它**，因为它**将代码耦合到Spring**，并且**不遵循控制反转**样式，在这种样式中，协作器作为属性提供给bean。`ApplicationContext`的其他方法提供对**文件资源**、**发布应用程序事件**和访问`MessageSource`的访问。这些附加功能在[（`ApplicationContext`的附加功能）Additional Capabilities of the `ApplicationContext`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.3.27/reference/html/core.html#context-introduction \"https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.3.27/reference/html/core.html#context-introduction\").中有描述。\r\n\r\n**自动装配**是获取对`ApplicationContext`引用的另一种替代方法。传统的构造函数和`byType`自动装配模式(如[自动装配协作器（Autowiring Collaborators）](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.3.27/reference/html/core.html#beans-factory-autowire \"https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.3.27/reference/html/core.html#beans-factory-autowire\")中所述)可以分别为**构造函数参数**或**setter方法参数**提供`ApplicationContext`类型的依赖。要获得更大的灵活性，包括自动装配字段和多参数方法的能力，请使用**基于注解的自动装配特性**。如果你这样做了，`ApplicationContext`被自动装配到一个字段、构造函数参数或方法参数中，如果有问题的字段、构造函数或方法带有`@Autowired`注解，则该字段、构造函数参数或方法参数需要`ApplicationContext`类型。有关更多信息，请参见[使用@Autowired（Using `@Autowired`）](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.3.27/reference/html/core.html#beans-autowired-annotation \"https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.3.27/reference/html/core.html#beans-autowired-annotation\")。\r\n\r\n当`ApplicationContext`创建一个实现`org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanNameAware`接口的类时，将为该类提供对其关联对象定义中**定义的名称**的引用。下面的清单显示了BeanNameAware接口的定义:\r\n\r\njava\r\n\r\n复制代码\r\n\r\n`public interface BeanNameAware {     void setBeanName(String name) throws BeansException; }`\r\n\r\n回调在填充普通bean属性之后调用，但在初始化回调(如InitializingBean.afterPropertiesSet())或自定义初始化方法之前调用。\r\n\r\n### 1.6.3. 其它`Aware`接口\r\n\r\n除了`ApplicationContextAware`和`BeanNameAware`(前面讨论过)之外，Spring还提供了广泛的`Aware`回调接口，让bean向容器表明它们需要特定的基础设施依赖。作为一般规则，名称指示依赖类型。下表总结了最重要的`Aware`接口：\r\n\r\n| 名称 | 注入的依赖 | 解释 |\r\n| --- | --- |

|\r\n\r\n再次注意，使用这些接口将代码绑定到Spring API，而不遵循控制反转样式。因此，我们建议将它们用于需要**对容器进行编程访问**的基础设施bean。\r\n\r\n## 1.7. `bean`定义的继承\r\n\r\nbean定义可以包含大量配置信息，包括构造函数参数、属性值和特定于容器的信息，例如初始化方法、静态工厂方法名称等。**子bean定义从父定义继承配置数据**。子定义可以根据需要**覆盖某些值**或**添加其他值**。使用父bean和子bean定义可以节省大量的键入工作。实际上，这是一种**模板形式**。\r\n\r\n如果您以编程方式使用`ApplicationContext`接口，则子bean定义由`ChildBeanDefinition`类表示。大多数用户不会在这个级别上使用它们。相反，它们在类(如`ClassPathXmlApplicationContext`)中**声明式地配置bean定义**。当您使用基于xml的配置元数据时，您可以通过使用`parent`属性来指示子bean定义，并将父bean指定为该属性的值。下面的例子展示了如何这样做：\r\n\r\nxml\r\n\r\n复制代码\r\n\r\n`<!-- 在指定了class的情况下，可以不指定abstract --> <bean id=\"inheritedBean\" abstract=\"true\" class=\"TestBean\"> 	<property name=\"name\" value=\"parent\"/>     <property name=\"age\" value=\"1\"/> </bean> <!-- parent指定需要继承配置的bean的名称 --> <bean id=\"inhertedChild\" class=\"ChildBean\" parent=\"inheritedBean\" init-method=\"init\"> <!-- 1 --> 	<!-- 重写属性配置 -->     <property name=\"name\" value=\"override\"/>     <!-- age继承父配置 --> </bean>`\r\n\r\n-   `1`处：注意`parent`属性\r\n\r\n如果没有指定，则子bean定义使用来自父定义的bean类，但也可以覆盖它。在后一种情况下，**子bean类必须与父bean类兼容**(也就是说，它必须接受父bean类的属性值)。\r\n\r\n子bean定义**继承**父bean定义的范围、构造函数参数值、属性值和方法覆盖，并具有添加新值的选项。指定的任何作用域、初始化方法、销毁方法或静态工厂方法设置都将**覆盖相应的父设置**。\r\n\r\n其余的设置**总是取自子定义**：依赖、自动装配模式、依赖检查、单例和惰性初始化。\r\n\r\n前面的示例通过使用抽象属性显式地将父bean定义标记为`abstract`。如果**父bean定义没有指定类**，则需要显式地将父bean定义标记为`abstract`，如下面的示例所示：\r\n\r\nxml\r\n\r\n复制代码\r\n\r\n`<!-- 在未指定class的情况下，必须指定abstract --> <bean id=\"inheritedBean\" abstract=\"true\" > 	<property name=\"name\" value=\"parent\"/>     <property name=\"age\" value=\"1\"/> </bean> <!-- parent指定需要继承配置的bean的名称 --> <bean id=\"inhertedChild\" class=\"ChildBean\" parent=\"inheritedBean\" init-method=\"init\"> 	<!-- 重写属性配置 -->     <property name=\"name\" value=\"override\"/>     <!-- age继承父配置 --> </bean>`\r\n\r\n父bean不能单独实例化，因为它是不完整的，并且它也被显式地标记为`abstract`。当定义是`abstract`的时，它只能作为**纯模板**bean定义使用，作为子定义的父定义。试图单独使用这样的抽象父bean，通过将其作为另一个bean的`ref`属性引用或使用父bean ID进行显式`getBean()`调用**将返回错**误。类似地，容器的内部`preinstantiatesingleton()`方法会**忽略定义为抽象的bean定义**。\r\n\r\n> 提示\r\n> \r\n> `ApplicationContext`**默认**预实例化所有的单例。因此，重要的是(至少对于单例bean)，如果您有一个(父)bean定义，您打算仅**将其用作模板**，并且该定义指定了一个类，则必须确保将`abstract`属性设置为`true`，否则应用程序上下文将实际(尝试)预实例化抽象bean。\r\n\r\n## 1.8. 容器扩展点（Container Extension Points）\r\n\r\n通常，应用程序开发人员不需要创建`ApplicationContext`实现类的子类。相反，可以通过插入特殊集成接口的实现来扩展Spring IoC容器。接下来的几节将描述这些集成接口。\r\n\r\n### 1.8.1. 使用`BeanPostProcessor`定制Bean\r\n\r\n`BeanPostProcessor`接口定义了回调方法，您可以实现这些方法来提供您自己的(或**覆盖容器的默认值**)**实例化逻辑**、依赖项解析逻辑等等。如果您想在Spring容器完成实例化、配置和初始化bean之后实现一些自定义逻辑，您可以插入一个或多个自定义`BeanPostProcessor`实现。\r\n\r\n您可以配置多个`BeanPostProcessor`实例，并且可以通过设置`order`属性来控制这些`BeanPostProcessor`实例运行的顺序。只有当`BeanPostProcessor`实现了`Ordered`接口时，你**才能设置这个属性**。如果编写自己的`BeanPostProcessor`，也应该考虑实现`Ordered`接口。要了解更多细节，请参阅[`BeanPostProcessor`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.3.27/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/config/BeanPostProcessor.html \"https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.3.27/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/config/BeanPostProcessor.html\")和 [`Ordered`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.3.27/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/Ordered.html \"https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.3.27/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/Ordered.html\")接口的javadoc。参见[程序化注册`BeanPostProcessor`实例（programmatic registration of `BeanPostProcessor` instances）](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.3.27/reference/html/core.html#beans-factory-programmatically-registering-beanpostprocessors \"https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.3.27/reference/html/core.html#beans-factory-programmatically-registering-beanpostprocessors\")说明。\r\n\r\n> 提示\r\n> \r\n> `BeanPostProcessor`实例对bean(或对象)实例进行操作。也就是说，Spring IoC容器实例化一个bean实例，然后`BeanPostProcessor`实例完成它们的工作。\r\n> \r\n> `BeanPostProcessor`实例的作用域为每个容器。这只有在使用容器层次结构时才有意义。如果在一个容器中定义了`BeanPostProcessor`，则它只对该容器中的bean进行后处理。换句话说，**在一个容器中定义的bean不会被在另一个容器中定义的`BeanPostProcessor`进行后处理**，即使两个容器都是同一层次结构的一部分。\r\n> \r\n> 要**更改实际的bean定义**(即定义bean的蓝图)，您需要使用`BeanFactoryPostProcessor`，如[使用`BeanFactoryPostProcessor`自定义配置元数据（Customizing Configuration Metadata with a `BeanFactoryPostProcessor`）](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.3.27/reference/html/core.html#beans-factory-extension-factory-postprocessors \"https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.3.27/reference/html/core.html#beans-factory-extension-factory-postprocessors\")中所述。\r\n\r\n`BeanPostProcessor`接口由两个回调方法组成。当这样的类被注册为容器的后处理器（post-processor）时，对于容器创建的每个bean实例，后处理器\r\n\r\n-   在**容器初始化方法**(如`InitializingBean.afterPropertiesSet()`或任何声明的`init`方法)**被调用之前**\r\n-   以及在任何bean**初始化回调之后**都会从容器获得回调。\r\n\r\n后处理器可以对bean实例**采取任何操作**，包括完全忽略回调。bean后处理器通常检查回调接口，或者它可能**用代理包装bean**。为了提供代理包装逻辑，一些Spring AOP基础设施类被实现为bean后处理器。\r\n\r\n`ApplicationContext`自动检测在实现`BeanPostProcessor`接口的配置元数据中定义的任何bean。`ApplicationContext`将这些bean注册为后处理器，以便稍后在创建bean时调用它们。Bean后处理器**可以以与任何其他Bean相同的方式部署在容器中**。\r\n\r\n注意，当通过在配置类上使用`@Bean`工厂方法声明`BeanPostProcessor`时，工厂方法的返回类型应该是实现类本身，或者至少是`org.springframework.beans.factory.config.BeanPostProcessor`接口，清楚地指示该bean的后处理器性质。否则，`ApplicationContext`不能在完全创建它之前按类型自动检测它。由于需要尽早实例化`BeanPostProcessor`以便应用于上下文中其他bean的初始化，因此这种**早期类型检测至关重要**。\r\n\r\n> 提示\r\n> \r\n> **以编程方式注册BeanPostProcessor实例**\r\n> \r\n> 虽然`BeanPostProcessor`注册的推荐方法是通过`ApplicationContext`**自动检测**(如前所述)，但您可以通过使用`addBeanPostProcessor`方法以编程方式在`ConfigurableBeanFactory`上注册它们。当您需要在注册之前评估条件逻辑，或者甚至在层次结构中跨上下文复制bean后处理器时，这是非常有用的。但是请注意，**以编程方式添加的`BeanPostProcessor`实例不遵循`Ordered`接口**。在这里，是**注册的顺序决定了执行的顺序**。还要注意，无论显式排序如何，以编程方式注册的`BeanPostProcessor`实例总是在通过自动检测注册的实例之前被处理。\r\n\r\n> **`BeanPostProcessor`实例和AOP自动代理**\r\n> \r\n> 实现`BeanPostProcessor`接口的类是特殊的，并且被容器**以不同的方式对待**。所有\\*\\*`BeanPostProcessor`实例和它们直接引用的bean在启动时被实例化\\*\\*，作为`ApplicationContext`特殊启动阶段的一部分。接下来，以排序的方式注册所有`BeanPostProcessor`实例，并将其应用于容器中的所有其他bean。因为AOP自动代理是作为`BeanPostProcessor`本身实现的，**所以`BeanPostProcessor`实例和它们直接引用的bean都不适合自动代理**，因此，没有将切面编织到它们中。\r\n> \r\n> 对于任何这样的bean，您应该看到一条信息日志消息:bean someBean不适合被所有`BeanPostProcessor`接口处理(例如:不适合自动代理)。\r\n> \r\n> 如果通过使用**自动装配**或`@Resource`(可能会回到自动装配)将bean装配到`BeanPostProcessor`中，那么在搜索类型匹配依赖候选项时，**Spring可能会访问意外的bean**，从而**使它们不适合自动代理**或**其他类型的bean后处理**。例如，如果您有一个带有`@Resource`注解的依赖项，其中字段或setter名称不直接对应于bean声明的名称，并且没有使用name属性，Spring将访问其他bean以**按类型匹配**它们。\r\n\r\n下面的例子展示了如何在`ApplicationContext`中编写、注册和使用`BeanPostProcessor`实例。\r\n\r\n#### 示例：Hello World, `BeanPostProcessor`风格\r\n\r\n第一个示例说明了基本用法。该示例显示了一个自定义`BeanPostProcessor`实现，该实现在容器创建每个bean时调用`toString()`方法，并将结果字符串打印到系统控制台。\r\n\r\njava\r\n\r\n复制代码\r\n\r\n`package scripting; import org.springframework.beans.factory.config.BeanPostProcessor; public class InstantiationTracingBeanPostProcessor implements BeanPostProcessor {     // simply return the instantiated bean as-is     public Object postProcessBeforeInitialization(Object bean, String beanName) {         return bean; // we could potentially return any object reference here...     }     public Object postProcessAfterInitialization(Object bean, String beanName) {         System.out.println(\"Bean \'\" + beanName + \"\' created : \" + bean.toString());         return bean;     } }`\r\n\r\n下面的bean元素使用了`InstantiationTracingBeanPostProcessor`:\r\n\r\nxml\r\n\r\n复制代码\r\n\r\n`<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <beans xmlns=\"http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans\"     xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"     xmlns:lang=\"http://www.springframework.org/schema/lang\"     xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans

class=\"scripting.InstantiationTracingBeanPostProcessor\"/> </beans>`\r\n\r\n注意`InstantiationTracingBeanPostProcessor`是如何定义的。它甚至没有名称，而且因为它是一个bean，所以**可以像其他bean一样对它进行依赖注入**。(前面的配置还定义了一个由Groovy脚本支持的bean。Spring的动态语言支持详见[动态语言支持（Dynamic Language Support）](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.3.27/reference/html/languages.html#dynamic-language \"https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.3.27/reference/html/languages.html#dynamic-language\")一章。\r\n\r\n下面的Java应用程序运行上述代码和配置：\r\n\r\njava\r\n\r\n复制代码\r\n\r\n`import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext; import org.springframework.context.support.ClassPathXmlApplicationContext; import org.springframework.scripting.Messenger; public final class Boot {     public static void main(final String[] args) throws Exception {         ApplicationContext ctx = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext(\"scripting/beans.xml\");         Messenger messenger = ctx.getBean(\"messenger\", Messenger.class);         System.out.println(messenger);     } }`\r\n\r\n上述应用程序的输出类似于以下内容：\r\n\r\nkotlin\r\n\r\n复制代码\r\n\r\n`Bean \'messenger\' created : org.springframework.scripting.groovy.GroovyMessenger@272961 org.springframework.scripting.groovy.GroovyMessenger@272961`\r\n\r\n#### 示例：`AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor`\r\n\r\n将回调接口或注解与自定义`BeanPostProcessor`实现结合使用是扩展Spring IoC容器的常用方法。一个例子是Spring的`AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor`——一个随Spring发行版附带的`BeanPostProcessor`实现，它可以**自动装配带注解的字段**、**setter方法**和**任意配置方法**。\r\n\r\n### 1.8.2. 使用`BeanFactoryPostProcessor`自定义配置元数据\r\n\r\n我们要看的下一个扩展点是`org.springframework.beans.factory.config.BeanFactoryPostProcessor`。这个接口的语义与`BeanPostProcessor`类似，但有一个主要区别：`BeanFactoryPostProcessor`在**bean配置元数据**上操作。也就是说，Spring IoC容器允许`BeanFactoryPostProcessor`读取配置元数据，并可能在容器实例化除`BeanFactoryPostProcessor`实例之外的任何bean之前更改它。\r\n\r\n您可以配置多个`BeanFactoryPostProcessor`实例，并且可以通过设置`order`属性来控制这些`BeanFactoryPostProcessor`实例运行的顺序。但是，只有当`BeanFactoryPostProcessor`实现了`Ordered`接口时，您才能设置此属性。如果编写自己的`BeanFactoryPostProcessor`，也应该考虑实现`Ordered`接口。有关更多细节，请参阅[`BeanFactoryPostProcessor`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.3.27/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/config/BeanFactoryPostProcessor.html \"https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.3.27/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/config/BeanFactoryPostProcessor.html\")和[`Ordered`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.3.27/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/Ordered.html \"https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.3.27/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/Ordered.html\")接口的javadoc。\r\n\r\n> 提示\r\n> \r\n> 如果希望更改实际的bean实例(即从配置元数据创建的对象)，则需要使用`BeanPostProcessor`(前面在[使用`BeanPostProcessor`定制bean](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.3.27/reference/html/core.html#beans-factory-extension-bpp \"https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.3.27/reference/html/core.html#beans-factory-extension-bpp\")中描述过)。虽然在技术上可以在BeanFactoryPostProcessor中使用bean实例(例如，通过使用BeanFactory.getBean())，但这样做会导致过早的bean实例化，违反标准的容器生命周期。这可能会导致负面的副作用，比如绕过bean的后期处理。\r\n> \r\n> 此外，`BeanFactoryPostProcessor`实例的作用域为每个容器。这只有在使用容器层次结构时才有意义。如果在一个容器中定义了`BeanFactoryPostProcessor`，则它**只应用于该容器中的bean定义**。一个容器中的Bean定义不会被另一个容器中的`BeanFactoryPostProcessor`实例进行后处理，即使两个容器是同一层次结构的一部分。\r\n\r\n当在`ApplicationContext`中声明**bean工厂后处理器**时，它会自动运行，以便将更改应用于定义容器的配置元数据。Spring包括许多预定义的**bean工厂后处理器**，如`PropertyOverrideConfigurer`和`PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer`。您还可以使用自定义`BeanFactoryPostProcessor`—例如，注册自定义属性编辑器。\r\n\r\n`ApplicationContext`**自动检测**部署到其中实现`BeanFactoryPostProcessor`接口的任何bean。它在适当的时候将这些bean用作bean工厂后处理器。您可以**像部署任何其他bean一样部署这些后处理器bean**。\r\n\r\n> 提示\r\n> \r\n> 与`BeanPostProcessor`一样，您通常**不希望将`BeanFactoryPostProcessors`配置为延迟初始化**。如果**没有其他bean引用`BeanFactoryPostProcessor`**，则该后处理器**根本不会被实例化**。因此，将其标记为延迟初始化将被忽略，并且即使您在声明`<beans/>`元素时将`default-lazy-init`属性设置为`true`, `BeanFactoryPostProcessor`也将被立即实例化。\r\n\r\n#### 示例:类名替换PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer\r\n\r\n您可以使用`PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer`通过使用标准Java `Properties`格式将bean定义中的属性值外部化到单独的文件中。这样做使部署应用程序的人员能够**自定义特定于环境的属性**，例如数据库url和密码，而无需修改容器的主XML定义文件的复杂性或风险。\r\n\r\nxml\r\n\r\n复制代码\r\n\r\n`<bean class=\"org.springframework.context.support.PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer\">     <property name=\"locations\" value=\"classpath:com/something/jdbc.properties\"/> </bean> <bean id=\"dataSource\" destroy-method=\"close\"         class=\"org.apache.commons.dbcp.BasicDataSource\">     <property name=\"driverClassName\" value=\"${jdbc.driverClassName}\"/>     <property name=\"url\" value=\"${jdbc.url}\"/>     <property name=\"username\" value=\"${jdbc.username}\"/>     <property name=\"password\" value=\"${jdbc.password}\"/> </bean>`\r\n\r\n该示例显示了从外部`Properties`文件配置的属性。在运行时，将`PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer`应用于**替换数据源的某些属性的元数据**。要替换的值被指定为`${property-name}`形式的占位符，它遵循Ant和log4j以及JSP EL样式。\r\n\r\nini\r\n\r\n复制代码\r\n\r\n`jdbc.driverClassName=org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver jdbc.url=jdbc:hsqldb:hsql://production:9002 jdbc.username=sa jdbc.password=root`\r\n\r\n因此，`${jdbc.username}` 字符串在运行时被替换为值\'sa\'，对于与属性文件中的键匹配的其他占位符值也是如此。`PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer`检查bean定义的大多数属性和属性中的占位符。此外，还可以自定义占位符前缀和后缀。\r\n\r\n使用Spring 2.5中引入的上下文命名空间，您可以使用**专用的配置元素配置属性占位符**。您可以在location属性中以逗号分隔的列表形式提供一个或多个位置，如下例所示:\r\n\r\nxml\r\n\r\n复制代码\r\n\r\n`<context:property-placeholder location=\"classpath:com/something/jdbc.properties\"/>`\r\n\r\n`PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer`不仅在您指定的`Properties`文件中查找属性。**默认情况下**，如果在指定的属性文件中找不到属性，它将检查Spring `Environment`属性和常规**Java系统属性。**\r\n\r\n您可以使用`PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer`来替换类名，当您必须在运行时**选择特定的实现类**时，这有时很有用。下面的例子展示了如何这样做：\r\n\r\nxml\r\n\r\n复制代码\r\n\r\n`<bean class=\"org.springframework.beans.factory.config.PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer\">     <property name=\"locations\">         <value>classpath:com/something/strategy.properties</value>     </property>     <!-- 配置属性 -->     <property name=\"properties\">         <value>custom.strategy.class=com.something.DefaultStrategy</value>     </property> </bean> <!-- 引用属性，替换类名 --> <bean id=\"serviceStrategy\" class=\"${custom.strategy.class}\"/>`\r\n\r\n> 补充\r\n> \r\n> -   properties中配置了key为`custom.strategy.class`，值为`com.something.DefaultStrategy`\r\n> -   Bean `serviceStrategy`的`class`属性取了`custom.strategy.class`对应的值\r\n\r\n如果不能在运行时将类解析为有效类，则在即将创建bean时解析失败，这是在非惰性初始化bean的`ApplicationContext`的`preinstantiatesingleton()`阶段。\r\n\r\n#### 示例：`PropertyOverrideConfigurer`\r\n\r\n另一个bean工厂后处理程序`PropertyOverrideConfigurer`与`PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer`类似，但与后者不同的是，原始定义可以为bean属性**提供默认值**，也可以根本没有值。如果重写的`Properties`文件没有某个bean属性的条目，则使用默认上下文定义。\r\n\r\n注意，bean定义不知道被覆盖了，因此从XML定义文件中不能立即看出正在使用覆盖配置器。如果**多个`PropertyOverrideConfigurer`实例**为同一个bean属性定义了不同的值，由于覆盖机制，**最后一个实例获胜**。\r\n\r\n属性文件配置行采用以下格式：\r\n\r\nini\r\n\r\n复制代码\r\n\r\n`beanName.property=value`\r\n\r\n下面的清单显示了该格式的一个示例：\r\n\r\nini\r\n\r\n复制代码\r\n\r\n`dataSource.driverClassName=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver dataSource.url=jdbc:mysql:mydb`\r\n\r\n该示例文件可以与容器定义一起使用，该容器定义包含一个名为`dataSource`的bean，该bean具有`driver`和`url`属性。\r\n\r\n也支持**复合属性名**，只要**路径的每个组件**(除了被覆盖的最后一个属性)都是**非空的**(可能是由构造函数初始化的)。在下面的例子中，`tom` bean的`fred`属性的`bob`属性的`sammy`属性被设置为标量值`123`：\r\n\r\nini\r\n\r\n复制代码\r\n\r\n`tom.fred.bob.sammy=123`\r\n\r\n> 提示\r\n> \r\n> 指定的覆盖值总是文字值。它们不会被翻译成bean引用。当XML bean定义中的原始值指定一个bean引用时，这种约定也适用。\r\n\r\n随着Spring 2.5中引入的上下文命名空间，可以**使用专用的配置元素来配置属性重写**，如下面的示例所示：\r\n\r\nxml\r\n\r\n复制代码\r\n\r\n`<context:property-override location=\"classpath:override.properties\"/>`\r\n\r\n### 1.8.3. 使用`FactoryBean`定制实例化逻辑（Customizing Instantiation Logic with a `FactoryBean`）\r\n\r\n您可以为本身就是工厂的对象实现`org.springframework.beans.factory.FactoryBean`接口。\r\n\r\n`FactoryBean`接口是可插入Spring IoC容器实例化逻辑的一个点。如果您有**复杂的初始化代码**，**用Java更好地表示**，而不是(可能)冗长的XML，那么您可以创建自己的`FactoryBean`，在该类中编写复杂的初始化，然后将定制的FactoryBean插入容器中。\r\n\r\n`FactoryBean<T>`接口提供三个方法：\r\n\r\n-   `T getObject()`：返回此工厂创建的**对象的实例**。实例可能是共享的，这取决于该工厂返回的是单例还是原型。\r\n-   `boolean isSingleton()`：如果此`FactoryBean`返回单例，则返回`true`，否则返回`false`。此方法的默认实现返回`true`。\r\n-   `Class<?> getObjectType()`：返回`getObject()`方法**返回的对象类型**，如果事先不知道该类型，则返回null。\r\n\r\n`FactoryBean`概念和接口在Spring框架中的**许多地方都有使用**。超过50个`FactoryBean`接口的实现随Spring本身一起发布。\r\n\r\n当您需要向容器请求实际的`FactoryBean`实例本身而不是它生成的bean时，请在调用`ApplicationContext`的`getBean()`方法时，在bean的id前面加上`&`符号。\r\n\r\n因此，对于id为`myBean`的给定`FactoryBean`，\r\n\r\n-   在容器上调用`getBean(“myBean”)`将返回`FactoryBean`的产品，\r\n-   而调用`getBean(“&myBean”)`将返回`FactoryBean`实例本身。', '', 2, 223, 949, '2023-06-04 22:21:41');

老规矩 打开vue3文档~\r\n\r\n`<Transition>` 是一个内置组件，这意味着它在任意别的组件中都可以被使用，无需注册。它可以将进入和离开动画应用到通过默认插槽传递给它的元素或组件上....\r\n\r\nvue3的文档写的非常详细,大家以后遇到不会的可以多去看一看,这里我就不展开,直接写代码\r\n\r\njs\r\n\r\n复制代码\r\n\r\n `<Transition name=\"down\">     <div class=\"message\" :style=\"style[type]\" v-if=\"isShow\">       <i class=\"iconfont\" :class=\"style[type].icon\"></i>       <!-- <span class=\"text\"><slot></slot></span> -->       <!-- 改造一下 -->       <span class=\"text\">{{ text }}</span>     </div>  </Transition>`\r\n\r\n组件上来是从上往下淡入,并且消失的时候是从下往上淡出,基于效果,开始书写Transition动画css\r\n\r\njs\r\n\r\n复制代码\r\n\r\n`// lang=\"scss\" 这里我用到了scss 所以对重复的属性进行了简写 .down {   &-enter {     &-from {       transform: translate3d(0, -75px, 0);       opacity: 0;     }     &-active {       transition: all 0.5s;     }     &-to {       transform: none;       opacity: 1;     }   }   &-leave {     &-from {       transform: none;       opacity: 1;     }     &-active {       transition: all 0.5s;     }     &-to {       transform: translate3d(0, 75px, 0);       opacity: 0;     }   } }`\r\n\r\n写完后发现,并没有出现动画, 这是什么原因? vue3有bug!\r\n\r\n原来使用的时候必须要使用\r\n\r\n-   由 `v-if` 所触发的切换\r\n-   由 `v-show` 所触发的切换\r\n\r\n基于这个特性,可以配合弹层关闭的效果\r\n\r\n##### 弹层自动关闭\r\n\r\njs\r\n\r\n复制代码\r\n\r\n`const { type = \'success\',duration=1500 } = defineProps<{   type?: Type,   text: string,   duration?:number // 传入展示弹层的时间(可选,默认显示1500) }>() const isShow = ref(false) // 当组件被挂载完成就显示 onMounted(()=> {   isShow.value = true   // 当duration时间过后，就隐藏   window.setTimeout(() => {     isShow.value = false   }, duration) }) <Transition name=\"down\">     <div class=\"message\" :style=\"style[type]\" v-if=\"isShow\">       <i class=\"iconfont\" :class=\"style[type].icon\"></i>       <!-- <span class=\"text\"><slot></slot></span> -->       <!-- 改造一下 -->       <span class=\"text\">{{ text }}</span>     </div> </Transition>`\r\n\r\n此时就完了利用组件完成功能\r\n\r\n上面说到,最终是需要通过引入方法的方式来实现,并且使用的方法是\r\n\r\njs\r\n\r\n复制代码\r\n\r\n`// Message({type:\'success\'}, \'登录成功\') // Message({type:\'error\'}, \'登录失败\') // Message.success(\'登录成功\') // Message.error(\'登录失败\')`\r\n\r\n这时候就需要使用\r\n\r\n首先按照文档学习一下vue3中h函数的使用方法\r\n\r\n##### 初识h函数\r\n\r\njs\r\n\r\n复制代码\r\n\r\n`import { h, render } from \"vue\"; // 1. 创建vnode // 第一个参数是标签名称或者是组件名称 // 第二个参数是属性 // 第三个参数是显示内容 const vnode = h(\'h1\', { class: \'title\' }, \'hello world\') // 2. render渲染  // 第一个参数是需要渲染的内容 // 第二个参数是挂载到哪个地方 render(vnode,document.getElementById(\'app\'))`\r\n\r\n此时页面中就可以出现h1标签内容为hello world\r\n\r\n![9389d344d21e9def282cc7b1cc84f5b.png](https://p9-juejin.byteimg.com/tos-cn-i-k3u1fbpfcp/f66388190b7240b2bc4629807dc64c02~tplv-k3u1fbpfcp-zoom-in-crop-mark:1512:0:0:0.awebp?)\r\n\r\n好, 有了h函数以及render的知识铺垫,我们接着写message组件\r\n\r\n##### 利用h函数改造message组件\r\n\r\n首先我们在对应的components下的messaga文件夹下创建index.ts文件\r\n\r\njs\r\n\r\n复制代码\r\n\r\n`import { h, render } from \"vue\" import MyMessage from \"@/components/message/message.vue\" // 往body中系只能一个盒子,目的是同时只能出现一次消息弹层 const divContainer = document.createElement(\'div\') as HTMLDivElement divContainer.classList.add(\'message-container\') document.body.appendChild(divContainer) // 按照基本写法的方式书写h函数 // 1. 创建vnode const vnode = h(MyMessage,{type,text}) render(vnode,divContainer)`\r\n\r\n此时就完成了基本的功能,但是我们最终要导入方法并 Message({type:\'success\'}, \'登录成功\')来使用,也就是调用函数的方法使用\r\n\r\njs\r\n\r\n复制代码\r\n\r\n`// 使用函数 type Params = {  type: \'success\' | \'error\' | \'warning\',  text: string,  duration?: number } function Message({ type, text, duration = 2000 }: Params) {  // 如果要像elui一样点击就创建 并且多次点击创建多个可以帮创建放在里面  // 往body中新增一个盒子 =>为了代码中  const divContainer = document.createElement(\'div\') as HTMLDivElement  divContainer.classList.add(\'message-container\')  document.body.appendChild(divContainer)  // 1. 创建虚拟dom  // const vNode = h(MyMessage, { type, text })  const vNode = h(MyMessage, { type, text })  // 2. 动态render  render(vNode, divContainer)  clearTimeout(timer)  // 3. 开启一个延时器,到时间就隐藏  timer = setTimeout(() => {   render(null, divContainer)   }, duration) }`\r\n\r\n##### 优化message组件的使用\r\n\r\n实际开发中,我们更希望利用\r\n\r\nMessage.success(\'成功\') Message.error(\'失败\') Message.warning(\'警告\') 来简化代码\r\n\r\n这就相当于帮我们再次封装了一层函数的调用\r\n\r\njs\r\n\r\n复制代码\r\n\r\n`// components/message/index.ts Message.success = (text: string, duration?: number) => {  Message({   text,   type: \'success\',   duration  }) } Message.error = (text: string, duration?: number) => {  Message({   text,   type: \'error\',   duration  }) } Message.warning = (text: string, duration?: number) => {  Message({   text,   type: \'warning\',   duration  }) }`\r\n\r\n在项目中的使用\r\n\r\njs\r\n\r\n复制代码\r\n\r\n`// 点击按钮 出现message弹层 const showSuccess = () => {   Message.success(\'成功\') } const showError = () => {   Message.error(\'失败\') } const showWarning = () => {   Message.warning(\'警告\') } </script> <template>   <button @click=\"showSuccess\">success</button>   <button @click=\"showError\">error</button>   <button @click=\"showWarning\">warning</button> </template>`\r\n\r\n##### 完结:\r\n\r\n此时我们就完成了message组件的封装, 在没做之前感觉很难,但是实际动手后,其实也是非常简单的, 重在实践, 除此之外,利用h函数也可以封装dialog弹层,原理也是一样的,大家可以动手写一下~\r\n\r\n好啦, 以上就是全部内容, 各位大佬, 可以给小瑜点个赞哦~ 手动撒花_★,°_:.☆(￣▽￣)/$:_.°★_ 。', '', 2, 639, 270, '2023-06-04 22:23:14');
